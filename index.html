<p>I like to write stuff. I was, at some point ,wondering if I should
take up writing as a profession, and in that frenzy I was looking up for
places to put up my work. However, in due time I realized that I did not
want money out of writing. I just enjoy writing , and it gives me some
escape from other things in this world. I was at this time , quite
accustomed to programming , and also realized that github provides a
sort of “free” (pun intended) website hosting provided that you keep the
source open.</p>

<p>Well, when it comes to writing , I have nothing to hide , so I
thought I might as well put up a site where I would post my stuff even
if no one looked at them. After all , I was doing this for myself , not
to mention the fact that I don’t even have to pay to keep the website
running.</p>

<h2 id="my-research-interests">Some Other Random Stuff</h2>
<p>I am an undergraduate student in physics. I am vaguely
acquainted with electronics , programming , simulations
and theoretical physics , and I have lower than normal grades in every
subject (thank you). I particularly like cameras and the various light
sensors that they use.</p>

<p>Sometimes I would like to write about some CS stuff, maybe a bash
tutorial or something , I don’t know</p>
