The owners of the Earth....

Hitler once said that the earth belongs to those who have the will to keep it and the power to take it.

The Tao teh king says that " He who wants to hold it in his hands loses it". 

I do not think the earth can be owned by anyone. Why ? Because Earth endures long. Even if all of humanity tries to own it, they would eventually lose it.

"I am sorry" I said to an unanswering night. I was sorry for being so focused on myself. Nature is vast and I am insignificant , so much so that it wouldn't respond to an apology. Not that it needed any.

There is nothing to brag about in this world. Perhaps the only thing that the universe exhibits is it's existence. Everything else exists alongside it , be it atoms or molecules or rocks or living organisms. We humans think too much into all this. There seems to be no end to all this thought and suffering. If we could accept things as they are, that is , that they just exist , I doubt we would need to suffer.

If we just accept that living organisms tearing each other apart is just something that exists, we can ve free from moralising it and also from complaining when we are torn apart. The logic that everyone deserves to live freely and without violence only works in the walled garden of human laws , and only amidst those who follow it. Once we accept the natural law, we realize this and no longer complaints.
