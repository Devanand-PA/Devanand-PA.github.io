It is the knowledge that something can go wrong that oftentimes gives issues to certain creatures.

To be blind is a blessing. To be shortsighted is a blessing, to be shorthearing is a blessing. To see things less clearly is a blessing.

In short, ignorance is a blessing.
It is a blessing worthy of the tao.

When there is no clarity of sight , there is neither beauty nor ugliness. When there is no word to be said, there is no room for judgement. When there is no substance, it has nothing to obscure it's path.

This is the greatness of the tao.It is both right and left justified.

The tao can be found on the left hand and the right.
