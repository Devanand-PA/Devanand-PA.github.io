The tao teh king says:

"If any one should wish to get the kingdom for himself, and to effect this by what he does, I see that he will not succeed. The kingdom is a spirit-like thing, and cannot be got by active doing. He who would so win it destroys it; he who would hold it in his grasp loses it."

I think that Laozi was talking about power , money , fame and greed. Perhaps it is possible to gain power, money  and fame, but those that do excert all their wills into it , and therefore do not want to lose want what they excerted so much will into.
It is because of this that they are offended when someone says "It will not last long". Because from their point of view , it will last long, because it 'has to' , otherwise all their struggles will prove meaningless. And humans don't like it when their struggles prove meaningless.
