			Dreams. Expectations.Hopes.<br>
			Almost everyone has some of these at some point in their lives.
			I had those too. Now that I look back at them, I wonder..<br>
			Was I wrong to have those expectations ?
		<p>
			"Get that ball !"<br>
			I looked in the direction of that shout. A big ball was coming up to my face. I tried to move
			away, but it still hit squarely in my face.
			<br>
			"Looks like he's hurt."
			<br>
			"Maybe we should call the teachers!"
			<br>
			"Are you an idiot ? We should run, else they'd scold us!"
			<br>
			The children all ran away.
			Why though ?
		<p>
			Just as I made sure nobody was around, so that I could cry , a chubby woman came into view.
			"Who are you , kid ?" She asked.<br>
			"My name is Eli Hart. I'm three years old".
			I replied just as I had rehearsed.
