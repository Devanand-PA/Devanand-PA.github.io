			How does it feel like to look for a job for the first time ? I don't know. It feels weird. I
			mean, I'm
			21 and I'm looking for a job for the first time. I've never done a part time job or an
			internship ever
			before in my life. Well, guess what ? I just flunked college (or not, because I'm technically
			going to
			get my bachelor's degree) after three years of being in that hell. However, it does feel a
			little weird.
		<p>
			So let me give you some context. I was enrolled in a five year BS-MS dual degree in the Indian
			Institute of Science, Education and Research (in Tirupati). As of today, I've convinced my
			parents to quit that program , although it's only been three years. According to the terms of
			the program, I am to get a Bachelor's degree in Science if I made it past the third year, which
			I have. I decided to quit that place because I thought it was suffocating. However, I couldn't
			convince my parents for a long time to let me quit.
			For the last few days , however, I have been holed up in my room watching anime all day and
			night (it was summer break) and my parents thought something was wrong. They tried to talk to me
			, but I had nothing to talk about.
			After this , they jumped to the conclusion that I was doing this to pester them to let me leave
			the college. They told me that I could leave if I wanted to. Hearing this , me (who had no idea
			what was going on) got up and agreed anyway. I'll still have to go to college for one last time
			to get that piece of garbage.
		<p>
			However, I'm still not sure if I want to quit college right now. Because here's the thing :
			I'll have a whole room to myself for atleast a year if I go to college, because my roommate
			left.
			My college doesn't usually replace people there. But if I go there, I'll be tormented by the
			amount of money that I'm wasting, because I just don't study. If I stay here , I'll be tormented
			by the fact that it is hard to get a job , and that even if I do, I'll probably not make enough
			money to survive. I'm messed up. This is the fact about staying in a developing or
			underdeveloped country - You always have to suffer from the pain of a suffering from tomorrow.
			My future is uncertain, and I don't know what to do. I have no skills that I can use. And I have
			no means of getting money, and I have no means of studying, because my brain refuses to study. I
			hope I'll have a good time tomorrow.
			In truth, I don't care that much about dying. I want to die. I hope I can find a way to die. I
			just don't want anymore pain or trauma. That's all
