Derelict idyll
---------------


# Brief
The story takes place 'after' Multiroz III : Zoilsour.
It is about one of the fractured dimensions left by Dendaro after the Conquerat war.

Ghost Clock is a fractured part of Distroyer Dunlop that incarnates because of the dimensional fracture.
The Nature Saint settles in this dimension and tries to lead Ghost Clock into coming in terms with his existence and gives him the book 'The Wizard of Vanity', but a part of Dimentionia keeps asking him why he exists.
Ghost Clock passes through the timeline of the world, finding writings from Rimuru, Kafka, and the like and sometimes helping people, soemtimes harming them, trying to decide on what he wants to do. The world is also home to 'creepers' - evil-turned versions of Ghost Clock that roam in parallel timelines and destroy Ghost Clock's efforts.

Ghost Clock also finds multiple stories and diaries about random people, and also about the history of Ciel and Rimuru.
The story ends with Ghost Clock realizing that he is forced to live an eternal loop in the fractured dimension and he has to bear with the pain of it nevertheless.

# Notes
-> In the game , the player can choose what to do in the story and choose which objectives to follow. Relevant NPCs will give optional objectives which can lead to discovering more lore.
-> Creeper count increases with death and decreases when creepers are killed.
-> The 'fracture' causes only parts of the world to be accessible to Ghost Clock. Dimensionia and the Nature Saint sometimes find another fractured dimension and make it accessible to Ghost Clock.
-> NPCs are unaffected by the dimension fractures. The Nature Saint explains that it is because Ghost Clock is a phenomenon of the fracture wheras the rest of the world exists partly in the fracture and partly elsewhere, and it's inhabitants feel that their experience is continuous. "Who would have thought Distroyer's ability would be it's prison ?"
